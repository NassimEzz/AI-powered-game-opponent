# AI-Powered Checkers Game Opponent Roadmap

## Phase 1: Game Logic and Initial Setup (20-30 hours)
### 1. Game Rules Implementation (5-7 hours)
- Set up the game board (8x8 grid).
- Implement the rules for Checkers, including:
  - Piece movement (regular, diagonal).
  - Capturing opponent pieces.
  - Kinging when a piece reaches the opposite end.
- Add validation to ensure moves are legal.

### 2. Game State Representation (4-5 hours)
- Create a representation of the game state (e.g., 2D array or bitboard) to track the positions of all pieces.
- Include functionality to display the board visually (text-based or graphical interface).

### 3. Player Input (3-4 hours)
- Allow human players to make moves.
- Add functionality to detect and validate user input.

### 4. Basic Turn Management (3-4 hours)
- Implement alternating turns between the human player and the AI.
- Ensure that after each move, the game state updates correctly.

### 5. Testing (5-6 hours)
- Test basic moves, game flow, and corner cases like capturing, multiple jumps, and kinging.

## Phase 2: Basic AI with Minimax Algorithm (30-40 hours)
### 1. Minimax Algorithm Overview (5-7 hours)
- Study the Minimax algorithm and understand how it can be applied to Checkers.
- Implement a basic version of the Minimax algorithm to calculate the AI's moves.

### 2. Evaluation Function (6-8 hours)
- Create an evaluation function to assess the desirability of a game state:
  - Example: Positive values for AI having more pieces, kings, or controlling the center; negative for the opponent.
  - Consider factors like piece count, position, and potential captures.

### 3. Minimax Search Tree (8-10 hours)
- Implement a search tree where the AI simulates all possible moves and their consequences.
- Depth-limited search to prevent excessive computation time.

### 4. Alpha-Beta Pruning (5-7 hours)
- Implement alpha-beta pruning to optimize the Minimax algorithm and reduce the number of game states to evaluate.

### 5. Basic AI Opponent (5-6 hours)
- Integrate the AI opponent with the game loop, allowing it to make decisions based on the Minimax algorithm.

### 6. Testing (5-6 hours)
- Playtest against the AI and refine the evaluation function based on performance.
- Test edge cases like forced captures or multiple jumps.

## Phase 3: Enhancing the AI (30-40 hours)
### 1. Improved Evaluation Function (6-8 hours)
- Introduce more complex evaluation criteria:
  - Piece mobility: Prefer moves that give the AI more options.
  - Board control: Favor controlling key areas of the board.
  - Piece safety: Prefer moves that avoid exposing the AIâ€™s pieces.

### 2. Iterative Deepening Search (5-7 hours)
- Implement iterative deepening to find the optimal move within a given time limit.
- Ensure the AI can make decisions within a reasonable timeframe.

### 3. Opening Book (5-7 hours)
- Research common opening moves and create an opening book for the AI to use in the early stages of the game.
- Use this book to avoid repetition and make the AI more challenging.

### 4. Endgame Tablebases (5-7 hours)
- Implement simple endgame tablebases, where the AI can consult precomputed optimal moves when only a few pieces remain.

### 5. Testing (7-10 hours)
- Test the AI against human players and assess its performance.
- Tweak the evaluation function and game tree depth to improve competitiveness.

## Phase 4: Learning AI with Reinforcement Learning or Neural Networks (20-30 hours)
### 1. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning (5-7 hours)
- Learn about reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning or deep Q-networks (DQN).
- Study how these algorithms can be applied to Checkers.

### 2. Basic Reinforcement Learning Setup (8-12 hours)
- Implement a Q-learning agent or a simple neural network model to predict and improve the AI's moves over time.
- Train the agent using self-play or against predefined AI opponents.

### 3. Reward Function (4-6 hours)
- Define a reward function for reinforcement learning that encourages desirable behaviors like capturing pieces, kinging, or avoiding getting captured.

### 4. Training and Evaluation (6-8 hours)
- Train the model through episodes of self-play or human-AI interactions.
- Test its performance and fine-tune the model for better strategy and learning.

### 5. Scaling with Neural Networks (optional, 10-15 hours)
- If you choose to use deep learning, implement a neural network (e.g., DQN) to handle large state spaces.
- Train it using a more advanced deep reinforcement learning approach.

### 6. Testing and Refining (6-8 hours)
- Playtest against the AI to evaluate its learning progression.
- Adjust the learning parameters, model architecture, and reward functions to improve performance.

## Phase 5: Final Touches and Deployment (10-20 hours)
### 1. User Interface Improvements (5-7 hours)
- Improve the user interface to make it more engaging (e.g., graphical board, animations).
- Allow players to adjust AI difficulty (e.g., changing the depth of the Minimax search or enabling/disabling learning).

### 2. AI Difficulty Adjustment (4-6 hours)
- Implement difficulty levels for the AI by adjusting search depth, evaluation function weightings, or learning rate.

### 3. Final Testing and Debugging (5-7 hours)
- Conduct thorough testing for bugs, edge cases, and performance bottlenecks.
- Playtest with human players and refine the AI's difficulty balance.

### 4. Deployment (1-2 hours)
- Package the project for deployment (e.g., as a desktop app or web app).
- If desired, deploy it on a platform like GitHub for others to use and contribute.
